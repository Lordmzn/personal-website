# CV Repo Upgrade — Brief for Claude Code

*Reference copy from the `cv` repo project, included here so the website content stays consistent with the CV's facts and voice. This is not a website document — it's the source-of-truth positioning brief for the CV itself.*

## Context

This repo contains the CV of **Emanuele Mason** (`lordmzn`), a PhD-trained AI/optimization
researcher and digital product builder currently working as Digital Solutions Manager at
Enersem. The CV exists in three versions that must be kept in sync:

| File | Language | Format | Use case |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| `europasseng_2` | English | Extended Europass | International / academic / tech |
| `europassita_1` | Italian | Extended Europass | Italian institutional / research |
| `onepageita_2` | Italian | One-page modern | Startups / quick reads |

---

## Brand Identity (apply consistently across all versions)

### Positioning
Emanuele is a **systems thinker** whose career is a coherent zoom-in: environmental
engineering → water resource management → RL/multi-agent AI → energy platform builder.
Not a series of pivots — a single deepening inquiry into how complex systems learn and adapt.

### Core philosophy (use as inspiration, not literal copy)
The one-page CV already captures this well:
> *"Cerco di praticare il Kung Fu — qualsiasi studio, apprendimento o pratica che richiede
> pazienza, energia e tempo per essere completato."*

This concept — mastery through patient, sustained effort — connects his technical work,
his martial arts, and his approach to research. It should inform the tone without being
forced into every section.

### Tone
- Precise and confident, not boastful
- Concrete over generic (say *what* you built, not just *that* you built things)
- Same intellectual register across Italian and English versions
- Avoid Europass bureaucratic flatness, especially in role descriptions

---

## Content Guidelines by Section

### Personal information
- Keep: name, nationality, date of birth
- Remove or leave blank: full address (privacy)
- Add if missing: `lordmzn.it` as personal website

### Work experience — Enersem (2018–present)
This is the primary professional identity. Descriptions should:
- Lead with **what was built and why it matters**, not just responsibilities
- Mention EMS platform concretely (cloud platform for energy monitoring, industrial plants)
- Highlight the dual track: **technical builder** (architecture, cloud infra, prototyping) +
  **research supervisor** (funded projects, TEPORE, LombHe@t)
- The progression from external consultant → *socio lavoratore* → Digital Solutions Manager
  is meaningful; make it readable as growth, not just title changes

### Work experience — Academic / research roles
- The PhD research thread (IRL, multi-agent systems, water management) should read as
  foundational, not just historical
- Research fellow + teaching assistant roles at PoliMi: keep concise, they establish
  institutional credibility
- Hydroelectric plant consulting (Castelletti, 2018) and Wetlands International (2017):
  keep as evidence of breadth, trim if needed in one-page version

### Education
- PhD: lead with the *method and problem* (inverse RL, multi-objective water management),
  not just the title. The cum laude and the thesis title are both worth keeping.
- MSc/BSc: keep grades (110/110 and 102/110 are strong), trim descriptions
- Penn State visiting scholar: keep — it signals international reach

### Publications
- Extended versions: keep full list, current formatting is fine
- One-page version: keep only the 3 highest-impact journal articles (A5, A4, A1) and
  the Best Paper Award. Move conference proceedings to "selected" if space is tight.

### Skills — Computing
Current lists are accurate and well-structured. Suggested reordering by relevance to
current role (most to least current):

1. **Cloud/Platform**: Python (Flask), JavaScript (React), PostgreSQL, Google Cloud,
   Kubernetes, Docusaurus
2. **Data/ML**: Jupyter, pandas, sklearn, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh
3. **Scientific computing**: Matlab, R
4. **Systems/infra**: Bash, C++, Elixir, Java, Git

### Skills — Languages
- Italian: native
- English: C1 written, B2 spoken (consistent across versions)
- French: remove from one-page (B1/A1 is not a working language — including it dilutes)

### Personal interests
The current text is good and honest. Ensure all versions include:
- Martial arts: **black belt in Tai Chi and Shaolin Chang style** (FESK), European
  historical fencing (1595 club) — both disciplines, not just one
- Keep Formula 1, hiking, rock concerts — they humanize without oversharing

### "Su di me" / About (one-page only)
This section is the strongest personal voice in any version. Keep the kung fu philosophy
paragraph. If rewriting, preserve the idea that curiosity + craft + patience are the
through-line — not just a list of hobbies.

## Consistency Checklist (verify across all three files)

- [ ] Dates align exactly (especially Enersem start dates: consultant Mar 2018, *socio*
      Jul 2020, manager Aug 2021)
- [ ] Role titles consistent (IT: "Responsabile sviluppo soluzioni digitali" /
      EN: "Digital solutions manager")
- [ ] Same publications list (same entries, same order)
- [ ] Same awards (IDEAS 2016 Best Paper, Tesi all'estero 2012)
- [ ] Enersem described as `s.r.l.` consistently
- [ ] GitHub links present and correct:
  - https://github.com/Lordmzn/pydmmt
  - https://github.com/Lordmzn/mogle
- [ ] Personal website: `lordmzn.it`
- [ ] Privacy consent clause present on all versions (GDPR / D.Lgs. 196/2003)
- [ ] Date of last update consistent (currently: November 22, 2024)

**Website-side note**: the `mogle` GitHub link above doesn't resolve publicly (checked during the website review — see `01-review.md` §5). Since the website's "MORE" project card says "previously known as MOGLE," this is likely just a naming leftover between the CV and the repo's actual current name, but it means the CV and the site currently both risk pointing at a dead link. Worth deciding whether to fix the CV's link, rename/publish the repo, or drop the reference — out of scope for the website work itself, flagging for whoever next touches the CV repo.

**Also note**: the IDEAS 2016 Best Paper Award's underlying publication reference in the CV appears to have a bracket typo — see `02-design-system.md` "Corrections" section for the detailed reasoning. Worth fixing in the CV repo too, not just the website.

## What NOT to change

- The Europass structure and section order — it's a known format for institutional use
- The one-page modern layout — it already works well visually
- The full publications list in extended versions — this is academic credibility, keep it
- The political/civic engagement entries (Consiglio dei Garanti, Giovani Democratici) —
  they demonstrate conflict resolution and organizational skills concretely

---

## Out of scope for this pass

- Website (lordmzn.it) redesign — this is now covered by the sibling docs in this folder
- LinkedIn copy — separate project
- New tagline integration into CV header — discuss first, then implement
